# TL;DR

To get started
- install rvm "https://rvm.io/rvm/install"
- install and select version 3.4.8 and install rails
  - $ rvm install 3.4.8
  - $ rvm 3.4.8
  - $ gem install rails
- clone this repo and open the directory with an IDE
  - *. I highly recommend JetBrains RubyMine. Don't torture yourself with configuring vscode or vim for ruby on rail from scratch.
