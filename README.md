# TL;DR

To get started
- install rbenv "https://rbenv.org/"
- install and select version 3.4.8 and install rails
  - $ rbenv install 3.4.8
  - $ rbenv global 3.4.8
  - $ gem install rails
- clone this repo and open the directory with an IDE
  - *. I highly recommend JetBrains RubyMine. Don't torture yourself with configuring vscode or vim for ruby on rail from scratch.
